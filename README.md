Lightweight Ruby/Sinatra Full-Stack Web App

First basic Ruby project through The Odin Project course. 

Created and completed caesar_cipher.rb first.

Then my next steps was to see if I could make it full stack.

I downloaded Sinatra as the framework to get my first basic full-stack app running. - app.rb

Then created index.erb to have a more compartmentalized structure to write out my HTML. views/index.erb

Next, in a public folder, created styles.css to stylize the page. public/styles.css
